## Objectives

The primary objective is to build an interactive application/ web app that can identify putative host-shifts where recent Covid sequences have evolved and jumped into a non-human host.
We provide a variety of non-human sequences, and allow the user to upload a sequence of their choice. Then the new sequence is placed into the alignment and a phylogeny is built.

Host shifts will be identified as the novel sequence being placed in clades of other sequences of host-shift sequences, such as that of the human-mink shift in fall 2020.
